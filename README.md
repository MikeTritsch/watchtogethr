## Description

Project #3 for the University of Texas at Austin specified that we create a MERN Stack Single-Page Application as a culmination of all of the skills we have learned throughout the course. Group #2, comprised of Michael Tritsch, Libby You, Martin Sandoval, Estevan Gonzales and Elizabeth Tucker, decided to create an app called Watchtogethr. 

Using the OMDB open-source API, as well as MongoDB and GraphQL, we created an app that will allow users to register, to find their friends, and to see the movies and television shows that they both want to watch. Picking a movie for movie night just got easier.

## User Story

AS A couple who can never agree on what to watch,

I WANT an application that will match up movies and shows my partner and I are both interested in watching,

SO THAT we can both agree on something to watch and stop endlessly scrolling.

WHEN I created an account on Watchtogethr, 

I CAN select the movies and television shows that interest me most.

THEN I can find friends, and see the movies and television shows we have in common.

When you create an account, inputting your email address, chosen username and chosen password, you are taken to a Profile page.



## Challenges

We were faced with several challenges when creating this app. React and Bootstrap made things difficult to customize, and creating MongoDB and GraphQL mutations and queries were certainly tempermental. Implementing the OMDB database with our system took the dedication of one of our team members for the duration of the project. 

Ultimately we all learned a lot, and are very proud of the results.
